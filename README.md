# Prework - *IOS Pre Work*

Submitted by: **Jonathan Soo**

**Ios Pre Work** is an app that... 
[TODO: Takens in user input]
[TODO: Greets the user]
[TODO: Change the background color to a random color with a button]
 

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    - Some features that I would want to add besides the required features and the once that I added are:
      - Adding an authorization page
      - Multiple pages
      - Make a cleaner UI
      - Make an app logo
      - Add a color wheel to pick a color instead of it being random
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    - Some challenges I faced were when I wanted to disable the submit button when the text fields were empty; I ran into some issues with some existing connections when I deleted the variable in Xcode. To fix this, I pivoted and added default values to the variables, keeping track of the value of the fields. When the text fields are empty
    -  Another issue I was having was that my computer had a lot of background tasks (lightroom, chrome, Spotify, dropbox). Those applications definitely introduced a bottleneck that I did not anticipate
